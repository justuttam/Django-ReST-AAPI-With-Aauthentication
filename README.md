# ReST APIs with authentication for managing items in an inventory using Django REST Framework and SQlite
This repository contains ReST apis for adding, updating, fetching and deleting the items in an inventory. Users can fetch the items without logging-in to the system. For adding, updating and deleting the items user must authenticate. User authentication is build using Token-Based Authentication. User must provide username and password when authenticating for the first time. A token would be generated that can be used in the subsequent requests for authentication.
If user forgets his/her token then by providing username and password they can request the token.
